# Change log for the Export quiz attempts report


## Changes in 1.1

* There is now a (slightly primitive) option to download all the attempts at a quiz
  using the helper script https://github.com/moodleou/save-answersheets.
* There are now setting for how much of the student's user identity is displayed.
* The name of the report, as it appears in Moodle's interface, was changed to
  'Export attempts' to better describe what it does.
* Fix some page layout issues with the generated PDFs.
* Fix details of the display of some question types.
* Tweak the page title when viewing an answer sheet. The main reason for doing this is
  that this determines the filename that web browsers use when saving or printing to PDF.
* A few other minor bug fixes.


## Changes in 1.0

* Initial version of the plugin.
